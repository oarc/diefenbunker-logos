These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [3] for the
Diefenbunker [0] by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable
Network Graphics (PNG) format [4] is now being used for all auto-generated
bitmaps.  The chosen fonts, "Arial" [1] and "Impact" [2] have proprietary
licenses and have not been included here.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.46, 0.47, 0.48) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.3.7, 6.6.0-4) [7]
  - Debian Linux "Squeeze" and "Wheezy" (6.0, 7.0) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate bitmap versions from the source vector .svg
files.
